"""Instance inventory from the Vast CLI.  (dv3ops P2, 2026-08-14)

Replaces the hand-edited IP/PORT block at the top of TASK MANAGER.txt and the
committed instance_list.csv, which had already drifted (it listed 2x5090 while
seven 5060Ti instances were live).

STICKY INDICES. Your index 4 must stay index 4 across refreshes, because it is
what you type and what alert titles say. Vast instance ids are the stable key,
so the mapping id -> index is persisted and only ever extended; a destroyed
instance frees nothing and a new one takes the next free number. Renumbering
on every refresh would be worse than editing by hand.

Read-only by design. This never creates or destroys anything: picking hardware
is a price judgement, and destroying loses whatever has not been pulled.

Runs on LOCAL WSL so the API key never lands on a shared cluster; the derived
env file is pushed to RCC.

Usage:
  refresh.py [--state ops/state] [--push-to RCC_HOST:PATH] [--dry-run]

# Host and port must be chosen as a PAIR. Vast offers two distinct routes in
# and their fields do NOT interleave:
#
#   direct : public_ipaddr  +  ports["22/tcp"][].HostPort   e.g. 1.2.3.4:13124
#   proxy  : ssh_host       +  ssh_port                     e.g. ssh3.vast.ai:17836
#
# Pairing public_ipaddr with ssh_port produces a syntactically fine address
# that nothing is listening on. It would present as a network fault rather than
# a config bug, and it is the exact mistake this file made on 2026-08-14 before
# the full JSON was available -- ssh_port and public_ipaddr had been reported
# together and looked like a pair.
#
# Direct is preferred because that is what this fleet uses (TASK MANAGER ports
# are in the 13xxx HostPort range, not the 17xxx proxy range).
