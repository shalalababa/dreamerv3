# Destroy a rented Vast instance -- but only once its data is provably
# somewhere else.  (2026-08-15)
#
#   dv3ops destroy N                 # REPORT only. Never destroys.
#   dv3ops destroy N --yes           # destroy, after the archive gate + prompt
#   dv3ops destroy N --force-unsafe  # destroy WITH unarchived data (typed ack)
#
# `vastai destroy instance` is described by Vast itself as "irreversible,
# deletes data". This wrapper exists so that irreversibility is only ever
# reached through a check, not through a memory of having synced.
#
# The standing rule this enforces (2026-08-08, after the delete-only incident
# that cost the rl/sh/vgo world models, the U1 uzf adapts and rgo/sgb seeds
# 9-16 -- gone for good): nothing is deleted without a VERIFIED archive
# elsewhere. Deleting an instance deletes every run dir on it, so the same rule
# applies here even though no `rm` is typed.
#
# What "archived" means here: every top-level run dir on the instance must
# exist on RCC with counters at least as large -- checkpoint step, score lines,
# file count and bytes. Greater-or-equal, not equal: RCC legitimately
# accumulates runs from several instances, and a bundle may add files.
#
# Creation is deliberately NOT here. Picking an offer is a price judgement and
# stays in the web UI; this tool only ever spends down, never up.
